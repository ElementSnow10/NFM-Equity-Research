This project aims to build an LLM-assisted, fundamentals-driven equity research system for the Indian stock market.
Inspired by top-performing LLM-based research frameworks (≈50% XIRR benchmarks), the system identifies, ranks, and continuously monitors the Top 50 fundamentally strongest companies out of ~6,000 listed Indian equities.

The model combines structured financial data, parameter-based scoring, and LLM-generated reasoning to produce transparent, explainable stock selection and churn decisions.
